# Insurance-Risk-Claims-Analysis-Dashboard
This project presents an interactive insurance risk and claims dashboard designed to analyse claim amounts, policyholder risk factors, and claim frequency patterns. The dashboard helps insurers understand where risk concentrates, how claims vary across demographics and vehicle characteristics, and how claims evolve over time.
